# Caesar Cipher with Python

A beginner-friendly implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm. Built while learning Python through the **100 Days of Code Bootcamp**.

This script lets users **encrypt** or **decrypt** messages by shifting letters of the alphabet by a chosen key â€” a great way to understand string manipulation, loops, and function design in Python.

## Features

- Encrypt plaintext messages using Caesar Cipher logic
- Decrypt encrypted messages by reversing the shift
- Simple command-line interface (CLI)
- Input validation and user interaction
- Easy to extend into GUI or web versions

---

## Tech Used

- Python 3.10+
- Built-in string functions and loops
- Optional enhancements with `string` module

---

## What I Learned

- String indexing and ASCII manipulation
- Looping through characters and applying transformations
- How classic encryption works at the basic level
- Designing clean, modular Python code

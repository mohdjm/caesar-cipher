# Caesar Cipher with Python üõ°Ô∏è

A beginner-friendly implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm.  
Built while learning Python through the **100 Days of Code Bootcamp**.

This project lets users **encrypt** or **decrypt** messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a chosen key.  
It started as a command-line tool and now includes a **Streamlit web app** version for easier access and sharing!
